# GuessIt Project

## Overview
The GuessIt project is an advanced machine learning application designed to handle out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words effectively. It includes a range of techniques and utilities to enhance the model's performance and user experience.

## Features
- **Subword Tokenization:** Utilizes models like BPE or SentencePiece for handling OOV words.
- **Robust Model Architecture:** Includes an enhanced vocabulary index and a robust embedding layer.
- **Progress Monitoring:** Integrated logging and progress indicators for real-time updates.
- **Parallel Execution:** Speeds up data processing using multithreading.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** GridSearchCV for optimizing model parameters.
- **Resource Monitoring:** Tracks CPU and memory usage during intensive operations.
- **Extensive Model Evaluation:** Evaluates the model using various metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## File Descriptions
- `progress_monitor.py`: Implements logging and progress indicators.
- `data_preprocessing.py`: Handles data loading and preprocessing.
- `model_training.py`: Script for training the machine learning model.
- `model_evaluation.py`: Evaluates the model using multiple metrics.
- `parallel_execution.py`: Enables parallel data processing.
- `hyperparameter_tuning.py`: Conducts hyperparameter optimization.
- `resource_monitor.py`: Monitors system resources like CPU and memory.
- `logging_config.json`: Configuration file for logging.
- `model_architecture.py`: Defines the machine learning model architecture.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview and instructions.

## Setup and Installation
1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed.
2. Install required libraries: `pip install tensorflow scikit-learn pandas tqdm psutil`.
3. Clone the repository or download the scripts.
4. Configure `logging_config.json` as needed for your logging preferences.

## Usage
1. Run `data_preprocessing.py` to prepare your data.
2. Execute `model_training.py` to train the model.
3. Use `model_evaluation.py` to evaluate the trained model.
4. For parallel data processing, integrate `parallel_execution.py` as needed.
5. To monitor system resources, use `resource_monitor.py` during data-intensive operations.
